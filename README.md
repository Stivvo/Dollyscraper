# Dollyscraper

Download lessons recorded with BigBlueButton or Collaborate from dolly using web
scraping.

## Dependencies

``python`` and ``selenium``:

```bash
pip3 install selenium
```

``wget``, Firefox and [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

``ffmpeg`` (optional, see below)

## Usage

```bash
python dollyscraper.py <user> <password> <url1> </path/to/outputfile1> (bigb|collab) <url2> </path/to/outputfile2> (bigb|collab) ...
sh </path/to/outputfile1>
sh </path/to/outputfile2> ...
```

Your dolly credentials must be given as first 2 parameters. <url> is the page of
the class with the links to the recordings, bigb and Collaborate are the
available platforms where videos can be downloaded from.

<outputfile> is a POSIX shell script generated by ``dollyscraper.py`` which uses
wget to actually download the videos (wget is called with the --continue option,
which prevents re-downloading). This allows to download videos without a
browser, edit the script afterwards and facilitates testing. Lessons will be
downloaded in parallell to maximize speed, this is why the progress can only be
checked from the log files:

```bash
tail -n 2 *.mp4.log
```

``dollyscraper.py`` generates ``lasturl.txt``, which contains the url of the
last available lesson. It will prevent useless requests to Collaborate the next
time new lessons will be downloaded. With bigb this is not necessary.

Some bigb lessons are actually made of two videos with the same duration: the
webcam (which the audio) and the deskshare (mute), which will both be
downloaded. If ffmpeg is installed, <outputfile> will join them.
